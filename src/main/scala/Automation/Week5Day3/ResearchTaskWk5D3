1. How do we handle file upload and download in Selenium?

File uploads are handled by sending the absolute file path to an `<input type="file">` element using `.sendKeys()`.

File downloads require configuring the browser (like Chrome) with preferences to auto-download files to a specified directory without prompting.

2.	How do we handle scrolling the page in Selenium?

Scrolling is done using JavaScript execution; you can scroll by a pixel amount with `window.scrollBy()` or scroll directly to an element using `scrollIntoView()`. These techniques help interact with parts of the UI not directly accessible through standard WebDriver commands.

4. What is a shadow DOM?

The Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows developers to encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that it doesn't interfere with the rest of the page. Elements inside a shadow root are not accessible using standard Selenium locators.
